# EE599-HW2-Q5_2
Write a function that takes a string as an input and reverses its value. The function has no output. It changes the value of the input parameter. ○ Example: Input: “EE599”, Output: “995EE” ○ You cannot use any new local variable of type string or vector or array. The reverse should happen in place (i.e. on the input vector).
